    "The data set obviously has a class imbalance (Control 32%, Parkinsons 53%, MSA 7%, PSP 7%).  We will need to resample the data or use an algorithm like Decision Trees that are not influenced as heavily by class imbalance.  We should also take care to see how well the under-represented classes are being predicted when evaluating accuracy of our models.\n",

To address the problem of class imbalance, the data was resampled (upsampling of the minority classes) to ensure that the minority classes were well represented in the models.  Alternative imbalanced class corrections can be explored in the future.   No additional preprocessing of the data was performed (scaling, feature selceti)\n",
